    "Our goal for learning Thermodynamics is to be able to predict if a process (e.g. chemical reaction) occurs under certain conditions.  The tools/laws of Thermodynamics will help us do this but classical Thermodynamics deals with macroscopic quantities (e.g. temperature, heat, or work for a mole of a substance).  As chemists, we are more used to thinking about chemicals and chemical reactions on the molecular level so first we must come up with a way to going from molecular properties to macroscopic properties.  This is the field of statistical Thermodynamics and the Boltzmann factor is one of the most fundamental concepts in this discipline.  "
