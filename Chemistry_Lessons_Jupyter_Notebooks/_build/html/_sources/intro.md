Welcome to Chemistry Lessons Using Jupyter Notebooks 
============================

This is book is a collection of lessons covering various topics in the undergraduate chemistry curriculum.  Each lesson is made in a Jupyter Notebook so most of them include a combination of written notes, equations, plots, and python code.  The code part, in particular, is meant to be interactive.  This can be achieved by launching the notebook in google Colab via the button on the top.  

The first chapter of the book is a brief intro to Jupyter Notebooks. 

The target audience for this book are undergraduate students, undergraduate chemistry instructors, and anybody else interested in using Jupyter Notebooks for chemistry instruction.

The current topics include Thermodynamics and Quantum Mechanics but will expand to other areas of physical chemistry (kinetics and statistical mechanincs), analytical chemistry, biochemistry, and general chemistry.
