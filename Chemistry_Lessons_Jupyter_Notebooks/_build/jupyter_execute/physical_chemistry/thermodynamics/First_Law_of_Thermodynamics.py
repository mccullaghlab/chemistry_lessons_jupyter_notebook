# # The First Law of Thermodynamics

# Thermodynamics is the study of how heat moves.  It tells us nothing about the time it takes for a process to happen but the laws of Thermodynamics have proven to govern whether things happen.  Things can be anything from macroscopic phenomenon to biochemical processes.  

# ## Learning goals for today:

# 1. Be able to state the first law of Thermodynamics
# 2. Define the internal energy of a chemical system
# 3. Define how a state function differs from a non-state function
# 4. Give at least three examples of state functions
# 5. Define a Thermodynamic system

# ## Statement of the first law

# 1. The internal energy of an *isolated system*, $U_{sys}$, is a *state function* and subject to conservation ($\Delta U_{sys} = 0$ if the initial and final states are the same).  
# 
# where an *isolated system* is one that cannot exchange heat or matter with surroundings, a *state function* has values that do not depend on the path taken, and $\Delta U_{sys} = U_{sys}^{final} - U_{sys}^{initial}$

# ## Internal energy

# The internal energy of a chemical system is a measure of the chemical (potential) and thermal (kinetic) energy in the system.  It is denoted *internal* because it does not include the kinetic and potential energies of the system moving as a whole or the interaction with the system and the surroundings.  Within the context of chemistry, things like bond energies and the non-bonded interactions that we have discussed would be included in the internal energy.

# ## State function

# State functions are important in Thermodynamics.  These functions do not depend on path but only the initial and final position.  Examples in Thermodynamics include change in internal energy ($\Delta U$), change in enthalpy ($\Delta H$), change in entropy ($\Delta S$), change in free energy ($\Delta G$ or $\Delta A$), and others.  State functions have the mathematical property of having an exact differential which will be important later on.

# Examples of things that are not state functions: work, heat, and other specific forms of energy.  

# ### Example of a state function

# Consider going from point $A$ to point $B$ anywhere on the globe.  
# 
# 1. Elevation, $Z$, is a state function: the elevations at points $A$ and $B$ only depend on where those points not how you got from point $A$ to point $B$.  The change in elevation, $\Delta Z$, is also then a state function.  
# 
# 2. Distance traveled is not a state function. There may be many different ways to get from point $A$ to point $B$ some of which will require traveling a greater distance.  We say that distance traveled is path dependent.  

# ## Thermodynamic system

# The concept of a *system* in Thermodynamics is somewhat vague but important.  A system can be defined as anything but is typically the substance/volume of interest.  This might be, for example, the beaker with the solution of interest during an experiment.  Key concepts regarding a system are: definition of the system, surroundings and types of barriers between system and surroundings.

# ### Types of Thermodynamic systems

# ***Isolated:*** An isolated system cannot transfer heat or mass between system and surroundings.

# ***Closed:*** A closed system is one that cannot transfer mass between the system and the surroundings.

# ***Open:*** An open system can transfer both heat and mass between the system and the surroundings.
