    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The chemical potential, or molar Gibbs free energy of a component, is an important quantity for multicomponent systems.  We saw that two phase equilibrium at constant temperature and pressure dictates that the chemical potentials of each phase be equivalent.  Here, we will show that the chemical potential can be determined from the partition function of the system.  This provides a tie between this quantity and the molecular level."
