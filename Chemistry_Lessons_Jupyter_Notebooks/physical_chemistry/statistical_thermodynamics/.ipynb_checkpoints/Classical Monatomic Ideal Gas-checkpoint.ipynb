If the particle is in a box with linear dimension $L$ (cubic box such that $L^3=V$) then each component of $\\vec{r}$ can take on values of $0 < r_x,r_y,r_z < L$.  The components of the momentum of the particle are not limited in the same manner.  Each component of the momentum can take on values of $-\\infty < p_x,p_y,p_z < \\infty$.\n",
