    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate of a chemical reaction is a measure of how fast the reaction occurs.  This rate will not be the same for all reactions and will not stay constant as a reaction progresses.  How fast a reaction happens is an extremely important aspect of a reaction for all sorts of things.  For example, how fast food rots/decays is important in our daily lives.  All food will rot/decay but we often choose to slow this down by putting it in the refrigerator.  "
