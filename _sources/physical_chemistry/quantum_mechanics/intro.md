Welcome to the lessons on Quantum Mechanics
============================

In these lessons we introduce the aspects of quantum mechanics relevant to physical chemistry.  We go through the standard anlytically solvable quantum problems of the particle in a box, harmonic oscillator, and rigid rotor.  Additionally, we introduce research relevant methods such as the variational approach and demonstrate how it can be used to solve these same problems.
